# REST API

## What is it?
This is a web application that perfoms CRUD operations from a mysql database.

## How does it work?
We do one of the CRUD operations by filling the textinput and when we click a button we will be send to a new page
and get some output from the button.

## Example
Let's say we want to read from the mysql database. We just have to enter a name of a city for example Marseille and when
we click the Read button we will be send to a new page and we will get information about the city.
The information we will get are: ID, Name, CountryCode, District and Population.
